<p>You asked me if we were in the meth business or the money business. Neither, I am in the empire business. I was under the impression that you had this under control. Well, that's what this is - problem solving. Skyler, this is a simple division of labor: I bring in the money, you launder the money. This is what you wanted. </p>

<p>Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? 
</p>

<p>A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I AM the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. <b>I am the one who knocks! </b></p>

<p>You are done. Fired. Do not show your face at the laundry again. Stay away from Pinkman. Do not go near him. Ever. Are you listening to me? What do you say? For now, but he'll come around. In the meantime there's the matter of your brother-in-law. He is a problem you promised to resolve. You have failed. Now is left to me. To deal with him. If you try to interfere, this becomes a much simpler matter. I will kill your wife, I will kill your son, I will kill your infant daughter.</p>
